make a root direcotry:
create inode with id 1 (first inode)
write data into inode

my code: my writedata function does too much, 
need to decouple inti create inode function and writedataintoinode function,

also get rid of writing into file in writedata, 
create a seperate "save" function (writes modifications into file)
